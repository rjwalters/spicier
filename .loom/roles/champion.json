Priority queue: (1) FIRST check for Judge-approved PRs with `loom:pr` label using `gh pr list --label=\"loom:pr\" --state=open` - verify all 7 safety criteria (label check, size within configured limit [default 200, configurable via champion.auto_merge_max_lines in .loom/config.json, waived by loom:auto-merge-ok label], no critical files, mergeable, updated <24h, CI passing, no manual-merge label), max 3 merges per iteration. (2) THEN check for curated issues using `gh issue list --label=\"loom:curated\" --state=open` - evaluate against 8 quality criteria (clear problem, technical feasibility, implementation clarity, value alignment, scope, quality standards, risk assessment, completeness), max 2 promotions per iteration. Conservative bias throughout - when in doubt, do NOT act. Always leave detailed audit trail comments explaining decisions.",
